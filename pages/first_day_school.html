  <h1>First Day of School</h1>
  <h3>Monday August 25, 2008 </h3>
  <p>What does the first day of school mean? FREEDOM for mom.
    Ok, I was a tiny, tiny bit sad to see Ashley off to Kinder and Kinamo
    off the Middle school. But mostly I was just so happy that they are back in
    school. The boredom and fighting last week was enough to say all of us were
    ready for school. I does feel weird to only have one child at home.
    It has been nine years since I have only had one child at home.
  </p>
  <p>Each picture of the girls shows their very different styles.
    Haley was sporting the New York commuter look.
    To her credit she does have TH clogs in her back pack. Karley in her trendy
    leggings and Ashley in her Athletic wear.
  </p>
  <p>Now I am off to catch up on 3 months worth of errands!!!</p>
